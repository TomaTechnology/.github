### Contribution

<b>Always push to main branch.</b>
Yes! We follow Trunk Based Development which requires care and maturity from the team. A few pointers:

- Focus on a single update at a time. Let the team know what you are working on.
- Commit locally for every critical change.
- Keep pulling to stay updated.
- Test before pushing.
- All repos have CI Test runner - check results after you push.

<b>Clear and consise commit names.</b>

- Keep your commit names consise and understandable.
- Rebase when commits are redundant and not critical.

<b>Branch out only for releases & experimental features.</b>

- Release branches will be very short lived. 
- Experimental feature branches may be long lived however do not let these go stale. Where possible, delete branches that are not being used. 

<b>Always Test Driven.</b>

- Any new code additions must begin with a test spec to ensure maximum coverage. 
- Exceptions are only made in case of UI code.

<b>Ask for help.</b>
- When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions except - "Is ETH/XMR a shitcoin?"
