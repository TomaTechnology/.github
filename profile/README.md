We are an organization building bitcoin infrastructure by toxic maximalist principles.


### Contribution

- <b>Always create a new branch for your contribution & use pull requests to merge your work to main.</b>
Our tier does not support enforcing rules on branches so its up to us to enforce these rules to keep our repositories safe and clean.

- <b>Rebase where possible.</b>
Keep your commit history clean by rebasing where possible. 

- <b>Clear and consise commit names.</b>
Keep your commit names consise and understandable.

- <b>Main branch must always be ready for release.</b>
The state of the main branch must always be ready for release.

- <b>Always Test Driven.</b>
Any new code additions must begin with a test spec to ensure maximum coverage. Exceptions are only made in case of UI code.

- <b>Ask for help.</b>
When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions.
