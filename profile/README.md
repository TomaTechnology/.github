We are an organization building bitcoin infrastructure by toxic maximalist principles.


### Contribution

- Always create a new branch for your contribution & create PR's to merge to main
Our tier does not support enforcing rules on branches so its up to us to enforce these rules to keep our repositories safe and clean.

- Rebase where possible
Keep your commit history clean by rebasing where possible. 

- Clear and consise commit names
Keep your commit names consise and understandable.

- Main branch must always be ready for release
The state of the main branch must always be ready for release.

- Test Driven
Any new code additions must begin with a test spec to ensure maximum coverage. Exceptions are only made in case of UI code.
