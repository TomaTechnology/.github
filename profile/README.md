### Contribution

- <b>Always push to main branch.</b>
Trunk based development requires maturity from the development team. A few pointers:

- Focus on a single update at a time.
- Commit locally.
- Rebase after your work is complete.
- Keep pulling to stay updated.
- Test before pushing.
- Push with care.


- <b>Clear and consise commit names.</b>
Keep your commit names consise and understandable.

- <b>Branch out only for releases & experimental features.</b>
Release branches will be very short lived. Experimental feature branches may be long lived however do not let these go stale. Where possible, delete branches that are not being used. 

- <b>Always Test Driven.</b>
Any new code additions must begin with a test spec to ensure maximum coverage. Exceptions are only made in case of UI code.

- <b>Ask for help.</b>
When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions.
