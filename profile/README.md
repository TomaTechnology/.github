### Contribution

- <b>Always push to main branch.</b>
Trunk based development requires maturity from the development team. It allows us to always stay upto date with each others work and avoids us working in isolation for long periods on separate branches. Move fast. Break fast. Fix Fast.

- <b>Rebase where possible.</b>
Keep your commit history clean by rebasing where possible. 

- <b>Clear and consise commit names.</b>
Keep your commit names consise and understandable.

- <b>New short-lived branches must always be created for releases.</b>

- <b>Always Test Driven.</b>
Any new code additions must begin with a test spec to ensure maximum coverage. Exceptions are only made in case of UI code.

- <b>Ask for help.</b>
When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions.
