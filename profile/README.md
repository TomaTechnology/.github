### Contribution

This applies to contributers with write access to a repository.

<b>Trunk based</b>

- Focus on a single update at a time. Let the team know what you are working on.
- Commit locally for every critical change
- Keep pulling to stay updated
- All updates pushed to trunk - no branching and PR for daily work
- 'trunk' is our 'master'/'main' branch

<b>Branch out only for releases & experimental features.</b>

- Release branches will persist as a point of reference.
- Experimental feature branches may be long lived however do not let them go stale. Where possible, delete branches that are not being used. 

<b>Test Driven.</b>
- Write tests where they make sense. 
- Keep tests flexible and not too strict unless required.

<b>Ask for help.</b>
- When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions except - "Is ETH/XMR a shitcoin?"
