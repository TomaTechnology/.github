### Contribution

This applies to contributers with write access to a repository.

<b>Trunk based</b>

- Focus on a single update at a time. Let the team know what you are working on.
- Commit locally for every critical change.
- Keep pulling to stay updated.
- Test before pushing.
- All repos have CI Test runner - check results after you push.
- All updates pushed to trunk - no branching and PR for daily work
- We call our 'master' or 'main' branch - 'trunk' to avoid confusion.

<b>Name descriptively</b>

- Make many small commits rather than one big one
- Keep your commit names understandable and as detailed as required
- Rebase when commits are redundant and not critical.

<b>Branch out only for releases & experimental features.</b>

- Release branches will persist as a point of reference.
- Experimental feature branches may be long lived however do not let them go stale. Where possible, delete branches that are not being used. 

<b>Test Driven.</b>

- Exceptions are primarily only made in case of UI code.

<b>Ask for help.</b>
- When in doubt ask for help. There are no stupid questions except - "Is ETH/XMR a shitcoin?"
